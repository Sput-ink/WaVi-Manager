# WaVi

This is a system designed to help different restaurants in the management of their reservations.

The backend services are implemented here, although it can be extended to other interfaces if possible.

## Implementation

### Development server

Run `yarn serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artefacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Run unit tests

Run `yarn test` to run the unit tests through [Node Test](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html).
